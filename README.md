# BleBox smartWindowBox – Home Assistant Integration

A fully featured **custom Home Assistant integration** for the **BleBox smartWindowBox** ([API level 20180604](https://technical.blebox.eu/openAPI_smartWindowBox/openAPI_smartWindowBox_20180604.html)).

This integration provides:

* ✅ Cover entity (open / close / stop)
* ✅ Emulated **set position (0–100%)**
* ✅ Favorite position support
* ✅ Next step support
* ✅ Rain sensor as binary sensor
* ✅ Real-time movement metadata
* ✅ Progress %, remaining time & direction tracking
* ✅ Proper Home Assistant entity services with UI selectors

---

## Features

### Cover Entity

The smartWindowBox motor is exposed as a standard Home Assistant **cover entity**:

* `Open`
* `Close`
* `Stop`
* `Set position (0=open, 100=closed)`

Since the official BleBox API does **not** support direct position setting, this integration emulates it by:

1. Sending open or close command
2. Polling device state
3. Stopping the motor once the target position is reached

This method is precise and tuned for real-world motor timing.

---

### Movement Metadata

While the window is moving (open, close, favorite, or manual movement), the following attributes are available:

| Attribute               | Description                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `moving`                | True while motor is active     |
| `move_direction`        | `opening` or `closing`         |
| `move_target_position`  | Desired target                 |
| `move_start_position`   | Starting position              |
| `move_elapsed_s`        | Seconds since movement started |
| `estimated_total_s`     | Estimated full travel time     |
| `estimated_remaining_s` | Remaining estimated time       |
| `move_progress_pct`     | Movement progress (0–100%)     |

These update live during movement.

---

### Rain Sensor

The built-in rain sensor is exposed as a:

```
binary_sensor.<device_name>_rain
```

* ON = Rain detected
* OFF = No rain

Additional attributes:

* `trend`
* `elapsedTimeS`
* `state`
* `iconSet`

---

### Entity Services

The integration registers proper entity services with UI selectors:

| Service                              | Description                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `blebox_smartwindowbox.favorite`     | Move to configured favorite position |
| `blebox_smartwindowbox.next_step`    | Perform next-step movement           |
| `blebox_smartwindowbox.set_position` | Move to specific position (0–100)    |

These appear in **Developer Tools → Services**.

# Installation

## Method 1 — Manual Installation (Recommended)

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Copy the folder:

```
custom_components/blebox_smartwindowbox/
```

into your Home Assistant configuration directory:

```
config/custom_components/
```

Your final structure should look like:

```
config/
└── custom_components/
    └── blebox_smartwindowbox/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── api.py
        ├── binary_sensor.py
        ├── config_flow.py
        ├── const.py
        ├── coordinator.py
        ├── cover.py
        ├── manifest.json
        ├── services.yaml
        ├── strings.json
        └── translations/
            └── en.json
```

3. Restart Home Assistant:

   * **Settings → System → Restart**

---

# Setup in Home Assistant

After restart:

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for:

```
BleBox smartWindowBox
```

4. Enter the IP address or hostname of your device
5. Finish setup

The integration will automatically detect:

* The motor
* The rain sensor

---

# How To Use

## Using the Cover

The device appears as a standard cover entity:

```
cover.motor_1
```

You can:

* Open
* Close
* Stop
* Drag the position slider

Position scale:

```
0   = Fully Open
100 = Fully Closed
```

---

## Using Favorite Position

Go to:

```
Developer Tools → Services
```

Select:

```
blebox_smartwindowbox.favorite
```

Choose your cover entity and run.

---

## Using Set Position Service

Service:

```
blebox_smartwindowbox.set_position
```

You will get a slider selector (0–100).

Example:

```
Position: 60
```

The integration will:

* Move in correct direction
* Track progress
* Stop exactly at the target

---

## Viewing Movement Progress

Go to:

```
Developer Tools → States
```

Open your cover entity and watch:

* `move_progress_pct`
* `estimated_remaining_s`
* `move_elapsed_s`

These update live while the window moves.

---

# Tuning & Advanced Settings

Movement precision is controlled by:

```python
POSITION_TOLERANCE = 1
POLL_INTERVAL_SEC = 0.20
```

Lower polling interval increases precision but increases API traffic.

Default polling interval while moving:

```python
POLL_INTERVAL_SEC = 0.20
```

This value has been tuned for reliable real-world accuracy.

# State Mapping (Based on Real Device Behavior)

| State | Meaning                      |
| ----- | ---------------------------- |
| 0     | Closing                      |
| 1     | Opening                      |
| 2     | Idle (intermediate position) |
| 3     | Idle (fully closed)          |
| 4     | Idle (fully open)            |

# Compatibility

* BleBox smartWindowBox
* API level 20180604
* Single motor configuration (current version)

---

# Known Limitations

* Position control is emulated (not native in API)
* Accuracy depends on motor calibration
* Rapid repeated commands may slightly affect precision

---

# Future Improvements (Ideas)

* HACS support
* Multi-motor support
* Dedicated progress sensor entity
* Configurable precision via UI
* Automatic overshoot compensation tuning
